Collections Framework:
 This is a critical topic in Java, as it provides efficient ways to store, retrieve, and manipulate data. You'll use collections extensively in real-world applications.

Collections Framework
What is the Collections Framework?

A unified architecture for storing and manipulating groups of objects.
Provides interfaces (e.g., List, Set, Map) and classes (e.g., ArrayList, HashSet, HashMap).

Why Use Collections?

Dynamic sizing (unlike arrays).
Built-in algorithms for sorting, searching, etc.
Easy to use and widely adopted in Java development.


Core Interfaces in the Framework

List: Ordered collection, allows duplicate elements.

    Classes: ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector.

Set: Unordered collection, no duplicate elements.

    Classes: HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet.

Map: Key-value pairs, keys must be unique.

    Classes: HashMap, LinkedHashMap, TreeMap.
